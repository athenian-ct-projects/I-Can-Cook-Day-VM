This part takes patience--when it's finished it should be as dark as chocolate and have a soft, \"cookie dough\" like consistency. Be careful not to let it burn! Feel free to add a little more flour or oil as needed to reach this consistency. Brown the sausage. In a separate skillet on medium-high heat place the sausage slices in one layer in the pan. Brown them well on one side (2-3 minutes) and then use a fork to flip each over onto the other side to brown. Remove to a plate. Cook the vegetables in broth. Add 1/2 cup of the chicken broth to the hot skillet that had the sausage to deglaze the pan. Pour the broth and drippings into your large soup pot. Add remaining 5 1/2 cups of chicken broth. Add veggies, parsley, and roux to the pot and stir well. Bring to a boil over medium heat and boil for 5-7 minutes, or until the vegetables are slightly tender. (Skim off any foam that may rise to the top of the pot.) Stir in cajun seasoning, to taste. Add meat. Add chicken, sausage, and shrimp. Taste and serve. At this point taste it and add more seasonings to your liking--salt, pepper, chicken bullion paste, garlic, more Joe's stuff or more chicken broth--until you reach the perfect flavor. Serve warm over rice. (Tastes even better the next day!)\"\"\")\n",

Pour yeast mixture into the bowl of an electric stand mixer (or into a large bowl if you plan on kneading by hand). Add remaining 1/3 cup sugar, warm milk, butter, egg and salt. Blend mixture until combine. While mixing on low speed, slowly add the flour, mixing until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 5 - 6 minutes. You may not use all of the flour called for! The dough should be soft, very slightly sticky when touched with a clean finger. It should be pulling away from the sides of the mixer. Grease a large bowl with cooking spray or a tiny bit of oil. Place the dough in the bottom of the bowl and turn it over once to coat all sides in oil (this helps keep it from drying out.) Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Allow to rise in a warm place until double in size, about 1 hour. Divide dough into two equal portions. Roll each dough ball out on a lightly floured surface into a large rectangle about 1/4â€™â€™ thick. Use a pizza cutter or sharp knife to cut the dough, lengthwise, into two pieces. Then slice the dough into six strips across so you end up with 12 small rectangles. Roll each small rectangle up like a snail and place, open edge down, on a lightly greased or lined baking sheet. Repeat with the second portion of dough. Cover rolls loosely with plastic wrap and allow to rise again in a warm place until double in size, about 1 hour. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Remove plastic wrap and bake rolls for 10 - 13 minutes until cooked and golden brown. Remove from oven and brush tops with butter. Store rolls in an air-tight container.
